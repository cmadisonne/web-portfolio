    <p class="w3-justify">I am going through a 6 month bootcamp at The Code Crew School here in Memphis, TN. I joined this program so that I can intergrate
        the skills that I learn as a developer with my passion for yoga.
        In these 6 months, we are learning multiple languages like Java Script and Python. We are learning to be full stack developers using MERN and Django.
        We are assigned exercises and projects after each lesson. My vision as a developer is to mix my innovative skills with my software skills to create
        an application that will greatly affect the yoga community and it's influence on other communities as well. This experience is playing a huge role in my pursuit to reach my goals by being the door of opportunity and the start to something great!
        Contained in this page are some of my best projects and personal work. Feel free to click around and check me out!
